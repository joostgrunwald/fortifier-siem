To run the PowerShell script as a service 24/7, you can use a third-party tool called NSSM (the Non-Sucking Service Manager). Here are the steps:
Download NSSM from https://nssm.cc/download and extract the contents to a folder on your computer.
Add the NSSM folder to your system's PATH environment variable, or navigate to the NSSM folder using PowerShell or Command Prompt.
Save the PowerShell script provided above to a file named PortMonitor.ps1 in a directory of your choice.
Open a PowerShell or Command Prompt window as an administrator.
Run the following command to create the service:
nssm install PortMonitorService "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\path\to\PortMonitor.ps1"  
 
Replace C:\path\to\PortMonitor.ps1 with the actual path to the PortMonitor.ps1 script you saved earlier.

Start the service with the following command:
nssm start PortMonitorService  
 
The service will now run 24/7 in the background, even after you restart your computer.

To stop the service, run:
nssm stop PortMonitorService  
 
To remove the service, run:
nssm remove PortMonitorService confirm  
 
Please note that running a script like this continuously in the background, especially as a service, may trigger security alerts on some systems.
